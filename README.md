> An extension to [mout](http://moutjs.com)/[lang](http://moutjs.com/docs/latest/lang.html) utilities for nerds

__mout-lang-type__ is an extension to [MOUT](http://moutjs.com)’s _[lang](http://moutjs.com/docs/latest/lang.html)_ utilities. It provides two modules: A `typeOf` and an `isType` function to be used instead of the included `kindOf` and `isKind` functions. The difference is that __types__ are expressed in _lowerCamelCase_ and represent the built-in objects `[[Class]]` internal slot tags while MOUT’s __kinds__ are expressed in _UpperCamelCase_ representing the overall tags of objects, even of so-called _non-standard exotic_ objects.
